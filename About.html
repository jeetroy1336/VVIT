			<h1><span>Welcomt To VVIT</span></h1>
			<p class="par">An engineering college where there is no teaching, but still there is 75% attendance compulsion.
				An engineering college where licking teacher’s boots give you grades in exams.
				An engineering college far away from the city.
				An engineering college killing creativity by giving assignments which are of no use.(true for most cases, instead if they can give some practical assignments then it can be a boon)
				An engineering college where labs aren’t as well maintained as classrooms. Because engineering is all about being practical not mugging up things in the classroom.
				An engineering college using dirty tactics to earn money.</p>
