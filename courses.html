I enrolled in this course hoping to kickstart a promising career in the tech world, but what I got was a masterclass in incompetence.</p>

			<p class="para">The curriculum for this BBA course seems to have been designed in the Stone Age. We're forced to study outdated business theories and models that have no relevance to the modern business landscape. It's as if the faculty hasn't realized that the world has moved on since the 1980s.</p>
