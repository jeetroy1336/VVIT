			<h1>Vidya Vihar<br><span>Engineering</span> <br>Collage</h1>
			<p class="par">If I could give zero stars, I would. My experience at XYZ Engineering College was beyond disappointing. The so-called "labs" were a joke – equipment that was barely functional and experiments that left us more confused than enlightened. The professors were more interested in their research than teaching, and it showed. I can count on one hand the number of times I felt engaged in a lecture. And the cherry on top? The complete lack of industry exposure. No internships, no connections, nothing. It's like the college thinks engineering exists in a vacuum. Well, surprise, it doesn't. I left this place with a degree that's worth about as much as the paper it's printed on. Don't make the same mistake I did – find a college that actually cares about giving you a relevant education.</p>
