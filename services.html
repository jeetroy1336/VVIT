            <p class="par">It's hard to imagine a more disappointing educational institution than this College. From the moment I set foot on its lackluster campus, I knew I was in for a ride that I'd regret.

                Facilities from the Dark Ages: The campus seems stuck in a time warp. Outdated buildings, worn-out furniture, and technology that's laughably obsolete. The so-called "library" resembles a forgotten storage room, with books that haven't seen the light of day since the 80s.
                
                Faculty of Indifference: The professors at this College must have taken a masterclass in disinterest. Most lectures involve reading directly from the decades-old textbooks, oblivious to the bewildered expressions of students. They seem to have forgotten what it's like to be enthusiastic about their subject matter, assuming they ever were.</p>
